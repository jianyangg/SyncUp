# Foreword / Preamble

Since we started university, finding a common time to collaborate has become a relevant problem more than ever before. As such, we took Orbital 2023 as an opportunity to find and implement an optimal solution to the problem of dealing with the hectic schedules of multiple people. Manually filling up availabilities is time-consuming and we wanted to improve on existing solutions like [when2meet](https://www.when2meet.com/). We brainstormed hard and `SyncUp` was the result.

`SyncUp` is a project management application that encourages a smoother collaborative experience - through seamless calendar API integration, it automatically uses event/availability data to suggest the best meeting times within a group. This is made possible through Flutter’s [calendar_v3 library](https://pub.dev/documentation/googleapis/latest/calendar_v3/calendar_v3-library.html#classes), as well as other existing frameworks that we have made use of.

# Aim

Our project aims to transform the way scheduling is done, making it a breeze for everyone involved. Our platform will also allow students from different faculties to have the opportunity to connect and collaborate on exciting projects together.
