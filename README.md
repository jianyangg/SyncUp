## **Team Name:**

SyncUp 

### **Proposed Level of Achievement:**

Apollo 11

### **Motivation**

As university students, we understand the importance of collaboration when it comes to achieving academic success. However, the process of coordinating schedules with peers can be a major obstacle that often leads to frustration and wasted time. **The traditional method of coordinating schedules through multiple exchanges of texts and emails is not only time-consuming but also prone to errors and misunderstandings.**

Furthermore, the current situation of remote and hybrid learning has only added to the complexity of syncing up schedules. With students located in different time zones due to overseas exchanges, juggling different class schedules and extracurricular activities, finding a common meeting time has become an even greater challenge.

That's why our app is here to help. By providing a centralized platform for students to schedule and manage their meetings, the app streamlines the coordination process, reducing the time and effort required to find a suitable meeting time. With features like real-time availability updates and schedule-conflict management, students can quickly and easily find a time that works for everyone. Our app not only saves time but also promotes better communication among students, making the collaborative process hassle-free, be it for casual study groups, project groups, or even CCA interest groups.

### **Aim**

Our project aims to transform the way scheduling is done, making it a breeze for everyone involved. Our platform will also allow students from different faculties to have the opportunity to connect and collaborate on exciting projects together.

**User Stories**

1. Students will be able to form specialised groups with their friends, colleagues for project members.
2. Within a group, through seamless calendar integration, our platform will generate a joint virtual calendar based on the group members’ common availability. This will enable students to easily identify mutual availability with other individuals of interest and schedule meet-ups accordingly. The platform will also handle the polling of available time slots to make the process even smoother.
3. Students will be able to effortlessly network with others from different faculties and form groups on our platform. Our system allows groups to indicate their intention of recruiting members of certain interests, making it easy for like-minded individuals to connect with each other.
4. Depending on the purpose of the group, there will be additional features such as shared to-do lists and file-sharing/real-time collaboration.
